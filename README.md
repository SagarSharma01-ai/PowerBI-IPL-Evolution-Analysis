### [View the Final Comparative Report (PDF)](The%20Evolution%20of%20the%20IPL%20A%20Comparative%20Analysis%20(2008%20vs.%202016%20vs.%202025).pdf)

This project analyzes the 17-year evolution of the Indian Premier League (IPL) by comparing three iconic seasons. The goal was to use Power BI to showcase how the game, team dominance, and player stats have changed.


## 1. Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI:** For building three distinct, filterable dashboards.
- **DAX:** For creating custom measures for each season.
- **Data Modeling:** Connecting 4 primary CSV files (Matches, Ball-by-Ball, Players, Teams).

## 2. Key Findings & Visualizations

This analysis proves the game has fundamentally changed.

### Finding 1: The Evolution of Power-Hitting
The most significant trend is the **108% increase in sixes** hit, from 623 in 2008 to 1,296 in 2025. The game has clearly shifted from placement to pure power.

## 3. Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Power-Hitting in Auctions:** Teams must now prioritize "power-hitters" as they are more valuable than traditional batsmen.
2.  **Invest in High-Economy Bowlers:** In a high-scoring era, bowlers with low economy rates are the key to winning championships.
3.  **Build a Balanced Team, Not Just Superstars:** The 2025 season proves this: Gujarat Titans had the best individual players (Orange/Purple Cap), but the more balanced team (RCB) won the trophy.
