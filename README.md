## 2. Key Findings & Visualizations

This analysis proves the game has fundamentally changed.

### Finding 1: The Evolution of Power-Hitting
The most significant trend is the **108% increase in sixes** hit, from 623 in 2008 to 1,296 in 2025. The game has clearly shifted from placement to pure power.

### Finding 2: The 2016 "Kohli Era" Anomaly
The 2016 season was a historic outlier for batting, driven by **Virat Kohli's** unbelievable **973 runs**. This single-season record remains the benchmark for batting greatness.

## 3. Strategic Recommendations
*(Aapki report se)*
1.  **Prioritize Power-Hitting in Auctions:** Teams must now prioritize "power-hitters" as they are more valuable than traditional batsmen.
2.  **Invest in High-Economy Bowlers:** In a high-scoring era, bowlers with low economy rates are the key to winning championships.
3.  **Build a Balanced Team, Not Just Superstars:** The 2025 season proves this: Gujarat Titans had the best individual players (Orange/Purple Cap), but the more balanced team (RCB) won the trophy.
